# GenAI Tutorial: Using Generative AI in Developing `cvstrategy`

This document describes how generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) were used
to assist the development of the `cvstrategy` R package.

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compare multiple cross-validation strategies
for selecting the regularization parameter in L1-regularized logistic regression.
The package provides both numerical summaries and visualization tools.

## 2. How Generative AI Was Used

Generative AI was used as a programming assistant throughout the project.

### 2.1 Algorithm Design and Structure

AI was used to:
- Discuss the differences between basic CV, warm-start CV, adaptive CV, and `cv.glmnet`
- Help design a consistent return structure for all CV methods
- Suggest reasonable stability metrics based on fold-level variability

Example prompt:
> "How can I compare different cross-validation strategies for L1-regularized logistic regression in R?"

### 2.2 R Package Development

AI assisted with:
- Writing R functions following package conventions
- Adding roxygen2 documentation
- Structuring the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files
- Debugging errors related to function exports and examples

Example prompt:
> "How do I add examples to a roxygen2-documented R function?"

### 2.3 Visualization

AI helped design visualization functions such as:
- CV error curves
- Coefficient path comparisons

Example prompt:
> "How can I visualize CV error curves for multiple methods using ggplot2?"

## 3. Limitations

While generative AI was helpful, all code was reviewed and tested manually.
Final design decisions and debugging were done by the author.

## 4. Conclusion

Generative AI served as a productivity and learning tool, helping accelerate
development and clarify best practices for R package construction.
