Version: 0.1.0

Description: 
    Provides a simple interface to compare four cross-validation strategies
    (basic, warm-start, adaptive coarse-to-fine search, and cv.glmnet) for
    L1-regularized logistic regression via glmnet. The main function takes a
    design matrix X and binary response y and returns a summary table with
    performance, runtime, and stability metrics. Plotting helpers are included
    for CV error curves and coefficient paths.
